__ULMFiT - Universal Language Model Fine Tuning__ <br> <br>
This method is one of the latest developments in the field of text classification in the hope that we can classify text much better. This concept focuses on understanding language rather than just text or words. ULMFiT makes use of transfer learning to create a Language Model.

ULMFiT proposed by Jeremy Howard and NUI Galway Insight Centerâ€™s Sebastian Ruder, is capable of predicticting next word in the sentence based on unsupervised learning of the WikiText 103 corpus. It uses multiple LSTM layers, with dropout applied to every layer which the secret behind this method. This was developed by Steve Merity (Salesforce) as the AWD-LSTM architecture.
